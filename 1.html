<h2>3D modeling </h2>
<p>In 3D computer graphics, <strong><u>3D modeling</u>
  (or three-dimensional modeling)</strong> is the process
  of developing a mathematical representation of any surface
  of an object (either inanimate or living) in three dimensions
  via specialized software. The product is called a 3D model.
  Someone who works with 3D models may be referred to as a 3D artist.
  It can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process
  called 3D rendering or used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena.
  The model can also be physically created using 3D printing devices.

<p style="margin-top:45px;">Models may be created automatically or manually.
  The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data
  for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting.</p>
